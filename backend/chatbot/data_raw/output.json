FOR EMPLOYMENT PASS (EP) HOLDERS:\n- Rental: SGD $1,490\n- Utilities (electricity, water, internet): SGD $52\n- Groceries: SGD $234\n- Dining Out (at restaurants or hawker centres): SGD $438\n- Public Transport (buses and MRT): SGD $81\n- Taxi/Cabs (e.g., Grab): SGD $70\n- Personal Care (haircuts, spa): SGD $44\n- Shopping (clothing, footwear): SGD $116\n- Subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify): SGD $20\n- Entertainment (movies, social outings): SGD $86\n- Mobile Bill: SGD $29\n- TOTAL BASIC COST: SGD $2,660 per month\n\nAdditional costs some people have:\n- Gym Fee: SGD $77 (but 73% of people do not pay for a gym)\n- Insurance: SGD $144 (but 68% of people do not pay for insurance)\n- TOTAL WITH EXTRAS: SGD $2,881 per month\n\n2. FOR S PASS HOLDERS:\n- Rental: SGD $864\n- Utilities (electricity, water, internet): SGD $25\n- Groceries: SGD $169\n- Dining Out (at restaurants or hawker centres): SGD $204\n- Public Transport (buses and MRT): SGD $81\n- Taxi/Cabs (e.g., Grab): SGD $50\n- Personal Care (haircuts, spa): SGD $39\n- Shopping (clothing, footwear): SGD $86\n- Subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify): SGD $10\n- Entertainment (movies, social outings): SGD $47\n- Mobile Bill: SGD $28\n- TOTAL BASIC COST: SGD $1,603 per month\n\nAdditional costs some people have:\n- Gym Fee: SGD $70 (but 73% of people do not pay for a gym)\n- Insurance: SGD $139 (but 73% of people do not pay for insurance)\n- TOTAL WITH EXTRAS: SGD $1,812 per month\n\nIMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR MIGRANT WORKERS:\nThe salaries for Foreign Domestic Workers (FDW) and some other migrant workers are lower than these cost of living figures. \nThis is because the employer provides accommodation and food, which are the two biggest expenses shown above (rental and dining out/groceries). \nA migrant worker's salary is meant for personal use and to send money home to their family, not to cover the full cost of living like a local or an EP holder."

You can get this done by following the steps below.\nFor non-Malaysian Work Permit holders\n- You can only transfer workers within the same business sector and you must have the consent of the existing employer. You can proceed to apply if the worker’s Work Permit is expiring in more than 20 days, subject to Work Permit criteria. For transfers within 20 days before the Work Permit expiry, you need to submit a request for pre-approval first.\n- If your pre-approval request is granted, you can proceed to apply for a Work Permit. The application will need to meet all the criteria for hiring a worker in your business sector (e.g. quota).\n- The existing Work Permit will be automatically cancelled once the related company gets the new Work Permit issued.\nFor Malaysian Work Permit holders\n- Get the related company to apply for a new Work Permit for the employee. Ensure that the company has sufficient quota.\n- Cancel the existing Work Permit when the employment ends. Cancellation must be done before the new employer requests to issue the new Work Permit.\nIf your company changes its name or contact details (e.g. address, phone number or email address), you must update the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board.\nThe CPF Board will then inform us of these changes. This will ensure that you continue to receive important messages and correspondences from us.\nNote: If your company is also changing its business entity (i.e. leading to a change in its CPF submission number or ACRA number), please refer to the above section on change in business entity instead.\nYou need to update us within 5 days if your worker's residential address or mobile number changes. Otherwise the worker may be penalised.\nHow to update\n- (For address updates) Ensure that the new address meets the relevant housing requirements.\n- Use the Online Foreign Worker Address Service (OFWAS) to update the address or mobile number.\nYou need to submit a request to us if you want to change the occupation of a Work Permit holder.\nYou can inform MOM through WP Online.\nYou need to inform us of changes in your worker's personal particulars (e.g. passport details).\nPlease do so by using WP Online to update the following details for your worker:\n- Name\n- Date of birth\n- Marital status\n- Passport number or expiry date\nFor other details, please submit a request to update the worker’s particulars and upload the relevant supporting documents (e.g. worker’s passport personal particulars page).\nWe will inform ICA of your workers’ new personal particulars. If they wish to clear immigration using the automated gates, they can do so 4 working days after you have received our email that their details have been updated.\nBefore you can change your worker's salary, you must:\n- Get the worker's written consent.\n- Inform us of the worker's new salary using WP Online.\nHowever, you are not allowed to amend the salary if the Work Permit is not yet issued.\nYou can submit a request to be a referee for your ex-work pass holder after you have cancelled the work pass.\nUpon receiving your request, we will:\n- Inform the prospective employer or employment agent who is applying for a work pass for the worker that you have offered to provide a personal reference check.\n- Release your contact details so that they can contact you to find out more about the worker’s conduct, character, or work performance, if they wish to do so.\nThe prospective employer or employment agent may also speak to the foreigner directly before deciding if they want to proceed to apply for the work pass.\nThis request will be valid for 2 years, but you can submit a request to withdraw at any time.\nWe cannot ban foreigners from future employment based solely on employer’s feedback. We can only do so if the foreigner has been charged and found guilty of an offence under Singapore law or infringed MOM’s regulations.\nWe are also unable to act based on non-employment related feedback from landlords, housing agents etc. They can choose to either seek legal advice, file a police report, or settle the matter directly with the foreigner.\nYou need to notify MOM.\nIf the worker is married, include this additional information:\n| If the worker's spouse is |\nInclude this information |\n| Singapore citizen or PR |\n- Spouse's full name and NRIC\n- Copy of marriage certificate\n|\n| EP or S Pass holder |\n- Spouse's full name\n- Spouse's FIN or Work Permit number\n|\nYou must do these within 1 week of knowing that your worker is missing:\n- File a missing person police report.\n- Cancel the Work Permit.\nFor a non-Malaysian worker\nIf the worker is not found within 1 month from the date the Work Permit was cancelled, $2,500 (half of the $5,000 security bond) will be forfeited to cover the repatriation and other related costs.\nIf your worker passes away in Singapore, you need to:\n- Cancel the Work Permit within 1 week from the worker's passing. Upload a copy of the following documents when cancelling:\n- Death certificate\n- Airway bill if the ashes or body has been sent back to the home country/region.\nOR\nBurial certificate if the body has been buried in Singapore.\nOR\nCremation certificate if the body has been cremated in Singapore.\n- Bear the costs of burial, cremation or the return of the body to the country/region of origin.\n- Bear the costs of returning the worker's belongings to their families.\n- Pay any outstanding salaries or payments to the worker's estate, e.g. the worker's next of kin or appointed trustee."

A diverse mix of nationalities enriches firms with new ideas and networks, and contributes to a more inclusive and resilient workforce.\nHow to earn points\nIf your organisation employs:\n- Fewer than 25 PMETs, your application will score 10 points by default.\n- At least 25 PMETs, your points will depend on the share of your candidate’s nationality among your organisation’s PMETs.\nYou can use the\nWorkforce Insights tool on\nmyMOM Portal to check the share of nationalities among your organisation’s PMETs.\nThe nationality of your organisation’s employees (including Permanent Residents) is based on the nationality indicated on their passport in the Singapore Government’s records.\nRelated questions:\nView all COMPASS-related questions\nThis criterion recognises organisations that create opportunities for the local workforce and build complementary teams comprising both local and foreign professionals.\nHow to earn points\nIf your organisation employs:\n- Fewer than 25 PMETs, your application will score 10 points by default.\n- At least 25 PMETs, your points will depend on your organisation’s local PMET share relative to its sector.\n| Organisation's local PMET share relative to its sector |\nPoints |\n| 50th percentile and above |\n20 |\n| 20th to less than 50th percentile |\n10 |\n| Below 20th percentile |\n0 |\nIf your organisation’s local PMET share is at least 70% (pegged to the 20th percentile of organisations economy-wide), your application will score at least 10 points.\nThis is regardless of where your organisation stands within its sector. In this way, we do not disadvantage organisations in sectors which have a relatively high share of local PMET employees.\nRelated questions:\nView all COMPASS-related questions\nThis bonus recognises jobs that require highly specialised skills, which are in shortage in the local workforce. The SOL is determined by a robust evaluation process that takes into account industry needs and local workforce development efforts.\nHow to earn points\n| Skills bonus |\nPoints |\n|\n|\n20 |\n- Job on the SOL\n- Share of candidate’s nationality among your organisation’s PMETs is 1/3 or more\n|\n10 |\nYou can use the Workforce Insights tool on myMOM Portal to check the share of your candidate's nationality among your organisation's PMETs.\nTo obtain the C5. Skills bonus:\n- Your candidate needs to perform the job duties listed for the specific shortage occupation.\n- You need to select one of the eligible job titles in your EP application.\n- Your candidate needs to meet checks on additional job requirements if they fall into either of these categories:\n- They need the SOL bonus points to pass COMPASS.\n- They are applying for a 5-year duration EP for a specific tech occupation on the SOL.\nRefer to the SOL Employer Guide to understand the additional requirements for EP candidates who require the SOL bonus points to pass COMPASS.\nWe will check the candidate’s job duties, past work experience and qualifications or industry accreditation for the declared occupation.\nRedeployment to another occupation\nCandidates who needed SOL bonus points to pass COMPASS or obtain a longer duration EP can only be employed in the specific shortage occupation. This will be clearly stated in the in-principle approval (IPA) letter’s “Important” note.\nIf they need to be redeployed to a different job, we will need to reassess if the candidate qualifies for an EP in the new job. You should notify MOM first, and we will then advise you on the next steps.\nCandidates who did not need SOL bonus points to pass COMPASS are not subjected to this restriction, but will still need to notify MOM.\nThis bonus recognises organisations that are either:\n- Undertaking ambitious investment, innovation and internationalisation activities in partnership with economic agencies\n- Endorsed by National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) as strong partners on company and workforce transformation activities\nSingapore seeks to anchor and grow firms that can contribute to the innovative capacity of our economy, enhance our global linkages, and strengthen our economic competitiveness. Such firms should also have the scale or potential to provide good jobs for locals.\nHow to earn points\n| Strategic Economic Priorities (SEP) bonus |\nPoints |\n|\nParticipate or meet the criteria for at least one of the eligible programmes |\n10 |\nThe award of the SEP bonus will be at the discretion of the supporting agencies running the relevant programme. MOM will notify your organisation if it has been awarded the SEP bonus and the points will be reflected in the Self-Assessment Tool (SAT). You may approach the relevant supporting agency if you have any queries.\nValidity of SEP bonus points\nThe bonus points will apply for up to 3 years, or for the duration of your organisation's participation in an eligible programme, whichever is shorter.\nRenewal eligibility for SEP bonus points\nAt the end of the validity period, your supporting agency will reassess whether to continue supporting your organisation for the SEP bonus for a further duration. This renewal will be subject to your organisation’s continued participation in an eligible programme and meeting both of the following criteria:\nThese criteria ensure that organisations eligible for the SEP bonus points make efforts to diversify and improve their workforce profile."

To ensure your quota is calculated correctly, please declare the paid salaries and CPF contributions of your local employees promptly and accurately.\nThe Local Qualifying Salary (LQS) determines the number of local employees who can be used to calculate your Work Permit and S Pass quota entitlement.\nA Singaporean or Permanent Resident employee employed under a contract of service, including the company’s director, is counted as:\n- 1 local employee if they earn the LQS of at least $1,600 per month.\n- 0.5 local employee if they earn half the LQS of at least $800 to below $1,600 per month.\nThe number of local employees will be updated every Saturday and you can check the quota balance on the next working day.\nAny late or non-payment of CPF contributions and salaries declaration will affect your quota and may cause your foreign workers to be allocated higher levy tiers.\nYou may:\nCalculate your quota\nIf you have never applied for a Work Permit or S Pass, you need to declare your business activity. Based on your declaration, we will assign your company to the most relevant sector, which determines the number of Work Permit and S Pass holders you can hire.\nLevy requirement\nThe foreign worker levy, commonly known as “levy”, is a pricing mechanism to regulate the number of foreign workers in Singapore.\nAs an employer, you must pay the levy for all your S Pass holders. The levy liability starts from the day the S Pass is issued and ends when the pass is cancelled or expires.\nYou should pay the levy using GIRO.\nLevy rate\nSince 1 September 2025, the S Pass levy rate has been harmonised to $650 across all sectors and levy tiers.\nThe daily levy rate is $21.37 for S Pass holders who did not work for a full calendar month. It is calculated as follows: (Monthly levy rate x 12) / 365 = rounding up to the nearest cent.\nNote: Levy rates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as required."

        "info": "Source: https://www.tal.sg/tafep/getting-started/fair/tripartite-guidelines\nAccessed: 2025-09-05\nTitle: TGFEP (overview)\nCategory: fairness\nHTTP: 200\n\nBeing Fair\n1. Abide by the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices\nThe Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP) help organisations adopt fair and merit-based employment practices. All employers in Singapore are expected to adhere to the Tripartite Guidelines.\nAccording to the Guidelines, employers must recruit and select employees on the basis of merit (such as skills, experience or ability to perform the job), and regardless of age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability. This list is not exhaustive and highlights more common examples of discrimination. TAFEP will look into all cases of workplace discrimination, even if they arise from attributes that are not cited as examples in the Guidelines.\nBeing Fair\nFair employers develop merit-based workplaces by adhering to the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, and implementing good employment practices.\nFair employment practices are based on the five principles below.\nRecruit Based on Merit\nRecruit and select employees on the basis of merit (such as skills, experience or ability to perform the job), and regardless of age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability.\nRespect Employees\nTreat employees fairly and with respect and implement progressive human resource management systems.\nProvide Fair Opportunities\nProvide employees with fair opportunity to be considered for training and development based on their strengths and needs to help them achieve their full potential.\nReward Fairly\nReward employees fairly based on their ability, performance, contribution and experience.\nComply with Labour Laws\nAbide by labour laws and adopt the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.\nFor additional information on how the Tripartite Guidelines may apply to the following employment practices, refer to:\n- Job advertisements\n- Job application forms\n- Job interviews\n- Grievance handling\n- Performance management\n- Dismissals\n- Retrenchments\nUnder the Fair Consideration Framework , employers who do not abide by the Tripartite Guidelines will face scrutiny from the Ministry of Manpower and have their work pass privileges curtailed. For example, they could be debarred from making and renewing work pass applications.\nWith effect from 1 Oct 2020, all employment agencies (EAs) have to meet new licence conditions to strengthen fair hiring practices. The new licence conditions will require EAs to comply with fair recruitment requirements stated in the TGFEP when recruiting on behalf of their clients. View the “Fair Recruitment Requirements - What Employment Agencies need to know” video here.\nJob Advertisements\nWhen stating the selection criteria in job advertisements, ensure that they are related to the qualifications, skills, knowledge and experience of the candidates. Don't use words or phrases that can come across as discriminatory.\nThe Tripartite Guidelines state what you must do as a fair employer. For additional information on how the Tripartite Guidelines may apply, refer here.\nAge\n- In general, avoid using age as a selection criterion unless you are bound by legal or regulatory requirements. In such cases, you may state this upfront. You may also state that a job is suitable for older workers, in support of national efforts to enhance employment opportunities for older workers.\n- If the nature of the job is physically demanding, such as in the handling of heavy cargo, state this requirement in the job description and avoid indicating a specific age group.\nFor example,\n| You can state | You should not state |\n|---|---|\n|\n|\nGender\n- Avoid using gender as a selection criterion unless practical requirements are involved. In such cases, you must state the reason clearly.\n- State that \"both genders may apply\" for gender-centric job titles (e.g. draughtsman, chambermaid).\nFor example,\n| You can state | You should not state |\n|---|---|\n|\nHealth spa requires female therapists to do personal body massage and spa treatments for its female customers. |\n|\nRace\nYou should avoid using race as a selection criterion.\nFor example,\n| You can state | You should not state |\n|---|---|\n| All races are welcome. |\n|\nReligion\nAvoid using religion as a selection criterion unless the job requires the applicant to perform religious functions or fulfil religious certification standards. In such cases, you must present the requirements clearly, objectively and sensitively.\nFor example,\n| You can state | You should not state |\n|---|---|\n| Hindu priest required to perform wedding ceremony. |\n|\nLanguage\n- If you require proficiency in a particular language, clearly state the reason for it.\n- Ensure that your job advertisement is in the same language as your advertisement media. If your job has any other language text, you should provide the reasons for it, which must be job-related.\nFor example,\n| You can state | You should not state |\n|---|---|\n|\n|\nNationality\nAvoid using nationality as a selection criterion. In particular, words or phrases that indicate a preference for non-Singaporeans should not be used.\nFor example,\n| You can state | You should not state |\n|---|---|\n|\nOnly Singaporeans |\n|\nMarital Status and Family Responsibilities\nAvoid using marital status or family responsibilities as a selection criterion.\nJob Application Forms\nThe Tripartite Guidelines state what you must do as a fair employer. For additional information on how the Tripartite Guidelines may apply, refer here.\n- Review your job application form to ensure that each field is relevant to the job (e.g. skills, qualification and experience). You may refer to TAFEP's sample job application form (Word document) for more guidance.\n- Remove fields on age, gender, race, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability. If you require information that may be viewed as discriminatory, you should state your reasons clearly.\n- Remove fields on photographs or national service liability. If you require these for specific purposes, you should request for these at the point of job offer or state your reasons clearly.\n- Allow for other forms of identification (e.g. passport number), as NRIC numbers can reveal the age of a person. If you require an applicant's NRIC number for specific purposes, you should request for it at the point of job offer, or state your reasons clearly.\nFor example, for the post of a Clerical Assistant:\n| You can ask | You should not ask for |\n|---|---|\n|\n|\nJob Interviews\nThe Tripartite Guidelines state what you must do as a fair employer. For additional information on how the Tripartite Guidelines may apply, refer here.\n- Create a list of selection criteria and apply this consistently for all candidates.\n- Create a list of interview questions that are directly related to the selection criteria. You may refer to TAFEP's list of non-discriminatory interview questions for more guidance.\n- Create a proper record of the interview, assessment process and job offer made, and keep these documents for at least one year.\n- Avoid asking discriminatory questions. If you must ask questions that may be perceived as discriminatory, explain these reasons to your interviewee.\n- Be transparent on your job requirements. For example, you should inform your interviewee if the job has irregular working hours or requires frequent overseas travel.\n- If you require a specific dress code, bring up the request in a clear and sensitive manner.\n- If you are unable to accommodate religious practices due to operational reasons, share your concerns in a clear and sensitive manner.\n- If tests are to be used for selection purposes, ensure that they are related to the job requirements, and review them regularly for relevance and unbiasedness in content or scoring.\nFor example, for the job of a Project Manager:\n| You can ask | You should not ask |\n|---|---|\n|\n|\nGrievance Handling\nThe Tripartite Guidelines state what you must do as a fair employer. For additional information on how the Tripartite Guidelines may apply, refer here.\n- Handle all complaints of discrimination seriously.\n- Conduct proper investigations into complaints.\n- Respond to the affected person promptly and proactively.\n- Record and file grievances confidentially.\n- Treat both complainant and respondent fairly.\n- Involve unions in the process for unionised companies.\n- Conduct training for all managers and supervisors involved in handling grievance.\nWorkplace Harmony\nA harmonious workplace is one where there is respect for and between all individuals at the workplace, regardless of their background and beliefs, so that everyone feels comfortable and safe to contribute and engage with others at work.\nEven as employers and employees are doing more to support various causes at the workplace, it is important to exercise sensitivity, especially when activities are held in support of causes unrelated to the business of the employer, or the job that employees are hired to do. This will contribute to workplaces remaining harmonious and productive.\nBuilding and maintaining a harmonious workplace\na. Employers should be sensitive to the diverse cultures, values and beliefs of their employees when developing, promoting or implementing events, programmes and policies that are not related to work.\nb. Support for any cause should not lead to bullying, harassment or ostracism at the workplace in any circumstances. Employers should provide employees with a safe environment to raise their concerns, including through a proper grievance handling process.\nc. Employees should be assessed for performance, promotion and related areas based only on work-related requirements, as stipulated in these guidelines.\nd. Employees should not be required or pressured to participate in events and programmes that are not related to work. Non-support or non-participation should not affect their employment outcomes.\ne. Employers should continue to demonstrate and communicate the importance of an inclusive and harmonious workplace.\nPerformance Management\nThe Tripartite Guidelines state what you must do as a fair employer. For additional information on how the Tripartite Guidelines may apply, refer here.\n- Develop measurable standards for evaluating job performance.\n- Review your criteria regularly to check against discrimination.\n- Document and keep all performance reviews for at least one year. This will help you appraise objectively during the next appraisal.\n- Set up an internal appeal process to address employees' questions or concerns on their appraisals.\n- Communicate posting and training opportunities to all eligible employees.\nDismissals\nThe Tripartite Guidelines state what you must do as a fair employer. For additional information on how the Tripartite Guidelines may apply, refer here.\n- Conduct an inquiry to allow your employee to present his/her case before you make a decision on dismissal. For more information, you may refer to Termination Due to Employee Misconduct .\n- Pay your affected employee on the last day of employment or within three working days from the date of dismissal\nRetrenchment\nBefore you start any retrenchment exercise, please refer to the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment (PDF) for alternative solutions.\nThe Tripartite Guidelines state what you must do as a fair employer. For additional information on how the Tripartite Guidelines may apply, refer here.\n- Always consult the unions (if your company is unionised).\n- Consider alternative solutions (e.g. job redesign or upskilling).\n- Use fair and objective criteria to select employees for retrenchment, and be empathetic."

This is part of the measures announced by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) last year to allow MDWs to rest and recharge from work, as well as form networks of support outside the household. MOM has also developed a guide to support employers and MDWs in initiating early conversations on the rest day arrangements, and to help employers plan for alternative arrangements for the household, if required.\nRest day arrangements must be mutually agreed upon\n2 MDWs and employers should come to a mutual agreement on the rest day arrangements. Arrangements for the monthly rest day can be implemented flexibly to suit the needs of both employer and MDW. For example:\n- The rest day can be taken as one full day or over two half-days. It can also be taken on any day of the week.\n- The MDW may choose to spend her rest day at home.\n- The rest day can be deferred by up to one calendar month. This means that, should both parties agree to defer the rest day in that month, the MDW should take her rest day by the end of the subsequent month.\n3 To support MDWs and employers, MOM has developed a guide which can help employers and MDWs discuss and agree on how the mandatory rest day will be taken. The guide also includes suggested rest day activities that MDWs can consider, and alternative care options that employers may tap on for their household’s needs. We urge employers, particularly those whose households have caregiving needs, to start conversations with their MDWs early and plan for alternative arrangements if required.\n4 We would also like to remind employers to update their MDW’s rest day information via the MDW eServices portal. Employers who require further information or advice on the rest day arrangement may call MOM’s hotline at 6438 5122.\nStrengthening support for MDWs and their employers\n5 “Supporting the well-being of our MDWs is important as they will also be better able to support their employers. The mandatory rest day policy strengthens the ecosystem of support for MDWs and their employers. There are courses or activities organised by community partners such as Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (FAST) and Aidha,” said Minister of State for Manpower, Ms Gan Siow Huang. “We encourage employers and their MDWs to initiate early conversations on their respective needs using the rest day guide, to come to a mutual agreement on the rest day arrangements.”\n6 Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Chairman of the Centre for Domestic Employees, added: “Having adequate rest is beneficial for one’s physical and mental health. We welcome the new measure, which will enable our MDWs to rest and support their well-being, and in turn, enhance their working relationships with their employers. CDE will work with MOM to help employers and MDWs adjust to this new policy change and assist with any concerns and queries about the arrangement.”"

You should also refer to the general Work Permit conditions and requirements.\nTypes of business activities\nThe process sector includes plants in the manufacturing of petroleum, petrochemicals, specialty chemicals and pharmaceutical products.\nThe production processes of these plants in the process sector involve specialised equipment and machinery. The construction and maintenance of the production units within these plants, which are classified as process construction and maintenance (PCM) works, require niche skills and expertise.\nSuch works are carried out by PCM contractors. They work with the process plant owners and engineering, procurement and construction companies to build and maintain the production units of the process plants.\nCompany requirements\nA business providing PCM services to plants must be a corporate member of the Association of the Process Industry (ASPRI). Before it can recruit foreign PCM workers, the business must also be endorsed by ASPRI as a PCM contractor and be included in the PCM Controlled List.\nFor more information on membership and registration, refer to ASPRI’s website.\nMigrant worker eligibility\nYou can only hire migrant workers who meet the conditions for source countries or regions and age requirements when applying.\nSource countries or regions\nYou can employ migrant workers from these countries or regions:\n- Malaysia\n- People’s Republic of China (PRC)\n- Non-traditional sources (NTS):\n- India\n- Sri Lanka\n- Thailand\n- Bangladesh\n- Myanmar\n- Philippines\n- Bhutan\n- Cambodia\n- Laos\n- North Asian sources (NAS):\n- Hong Kong (HKSAR passport)\n- Macau\n- South Korea\n- Taiwan\nAge requirements\nThe minimum age for all non-domestic migrant workers is 18 years old.\nWhen applying for a Work Permit, all non-domestic migrant workers (regardless of nationality) must be below 61 years old.\nWork Permit holders can work any number of years, and up to a maximum age of 63 years old.\nWorker requirements and approved occupations\nMigrant workers employed for PCM works are not allowed to be involved in the plant’s operations (operating plant equipment, warehousing and packing, etc.) or peripheral services (grass cutting, cleaning of offices, roads, waste disposal etc.).\nThey can only perform activities related to the construction, preventive and breakdown maintenance of plant equipment.\nPCM works require these 13 skill sets:\n- Electrical and Instrumentation works\n- General fitting\n- Machine fitting\n- Metal Scaffolding\n- Painting and blasting\n- Plant civil works\n- Plant equipment fitting\n- Process pipefitting\n- Refractory\n- Rigging and material handling\n- Rotating equipment fitting\n- Thermal insulation\n- Welding\nNTS and PRC Work Permit holders in the process sector can only be employed as “Process Maintenance and Construction Worker”, “Process Maintenance Construction Worker-cum-Driver” or \"Driver (Process)\".\nQuota and levy\nThe number of Work Permit holders that you can hire is limited by quota (or dependency ratio ceiling) and subject to a levy.\nUnder the process sector quota, you can employ 5 Work Permit holders for every local employee who earns the Local Qualifying Salary.\nThe levy rate is as follows:\n| Source country or region / Tier\n|\nMonthly\n|\nDaily\n|\n| NTS - Higher-skilled |\n$300\n|\n$9.87\n|\n| NTS - Basic-skilled |\n$650\n|\n$21.37 |\n| Malaysia, NAS, PRC - Higher-skilled |\n$200\n|\n$6.58 |\n| Malaysia, NAS, PRC - Basic-skilled |\n$450\n|\n$14.79 |\nCalculate your quota\nNote:\n- The daily levy rate only applies to Work Permit holders who did not work for a full calendar month.

        "info": "Source: https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/employment-practices/guidelines/tripartite-guidelines-on-wrongful-dismissal.pdf\nAccessed: 2025-09-05\nTitle: Tripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal (PDF)\nCategory: disputes\nHTTP: 200\n\nFRIDAY, JUL Y  26, 2024 1\nFirst published in the Government Gazette , Electronic Edition, on 23 July 2024 at 5 pm.\nNo. 0000  –– EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS ACT 2016\nTRIPARTITE GUIDELINES ON WRONGFUL DISMISSAL\n(I) Introduction\n1. A dismissal is defined as a termination of a contract of service between an \nemployer and an employee at the initiative of the employer, with or without notice, \nincluding salary-in-lieu of notice. It also includes involuntary resignation.\n2. In accordance with the Employment Act, dismissing an employee without \njust or sufficient cause is wrongful. These Tripartite Guidelines on Wrongful \nDismissal provides illustrations to guide employers, employees, mediators, and \nadjudicators on what constitutes dismissals that are not wrongful and what \nconstitutes wrongful dismissal under the Employment Act.\n3. Both employee and employer have the right to contractually terminate \ntheir employment relationship. But cases may arise in which an employer believes \nhe contractually terminated the employment relationship, but the employee believes \nthat he was wrongfully dismissed. In order to reach an objective appraisal of the \nfacts, and to resolve the matter, an employee can file a mediation request with the \nTripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM).\n(II) Circumstances where misconduct or poor performance are cited\n4. Where misconduct or poor performance is cited as the reason for the \ndismissal, the employer bears the burden of proving that ground for dismissal. \nThe dismissal is considered wrongful if the employer is unable to do so.\nMisconduct\n5. Misconduct is the only legitimate reason for dismissal without notice. \nAn employer may, after due inquiry, dismiss an employee without notice for \nmisconduct. Misconduct includes but is not limited to theft, dishonest or disorderly \nconduct at work, insubordination, and bringing the organisation into disrepute.\nIllustration 1\nA was employed as a preschool teacher. He hit a student. An inquiry was \ndone which established this fact. The employer dismissed A on the ground of \nmisconduct, as hitting a student fell short of the conduct expected of a teacher \ntowards his students.\nThis dismissal was due to misconduct, and was not wrongful as it was based on \nthe following:\n(a) Hitting a student fell short of the conduct expected of a teacher towards \na child under his care and protection; and\n(b) A was given a chance to be heard, but could not offer any legitimate \nexplanation for falling short of the conduct expected of him.\n\n REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT GAZETTE 2\nPoor Performance\n6. In a case of poor performance, an employer cannot dismiss without \nnotice. The employer would need to substantiate if poor performance is cited as \nthe reason for dismissal with notice.\nIllustration 2\nB was employed as a warehouse assistant. She was involved in multiple \nincidents that resulted in poor quality services provided by the warehouse. Her \nsupervisor documented these shortcomings in the performance reviews. Despite \nthis, her performance did not improve. The employer dismissed B with notice \nand stated that this was because of B’s poor work performance.\nThis dismissal was not wrongful. There was documented proof of B’s poor \nperformance and the employer rightly exercised his right to terminate (with \nnotice) the employment.\nIf, on the other hand, the employer terminated the contract without notice, the \ndismissal would have been wrongful because it is not clear that B’s performance \nwas so poor as to amount to misconduct. Furthermore, the employer had not \nconducted a proper inquiry and given B a chance to be heard (see Illustration 1).\n(III) Circumstances where the right to contractually terminate is invoked\n7. As both employee and employer have a right to contractually terminate \nemployment with notice, dismissals with notice are presumed not to be wrongful.\nIllustration 3\nC was dismissed with notice. His employer did not give any reason for the \ndismissal. When C asked for a reason, the employer continued to not give a \nreason, and explained that it was termination in accordance with the contract. C \nis unable to point to any facts, incidents or situations which could suggest that \nthe employer’s intention was anything other than termination in accordance \nwith the contract.\nThis dismissal with notice was not wrongful.\n\nFRIDAY, JUL Y  26, 2024 3\nRedundancy\n8. For avoidance of doubt, redundancy is another legitimate reason for \ndismissing an employee with notice1. Redundancy occurs when the employer has \nexcess manpower, the company is undergoing restructuring, the old job no longer \nexists, or the employee’s job scope has changed.\nIllustration 4\nAn F&B establishment underwent restructuring to focus on its food operations \nand less on its bar operations. As a result, the employer dismissed the bartender, \nD, with notice. D claimed that his dismissal was wrongful.\nThe dismissal was on the ground of redundancy and was not wrongful. The \nemployer was indeed changing his business model and no longer needed the \nservices of D.\n(IV) Circumstances where dismissal with notice is wrongful\n9. To succeed in claiming that a dismissal with notice is wrongful (where \nno reason is given for the dismissal), an employee must substantiate a wrongful \nreason for the dismissal. Wrongful reasons include discrimination, deprivation \nof benefit, or to punish an employee for exercising his employment right. If an \nemployer gives a reason for dismissal with notice, but the reason given is proven \nto be false, the dismissal would also be wrongful.\n10. Dismissing an employee because of discrimination e.g. against the \nemployee’s age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, \nor disability is wrongful.\nIllustration 5\nAn employer dismissed E with notice. No reason was given for the dismissal.\nBut E reported that the employer had made numerous discriminatory remarks \nabout the employee’s race, stating that he preferred to hire someone of another \nrace. This was confirmed by other employees.\nEven though the employer dismissed E with notice, the employer’s conduct \nshowed that he adopted a discriminatory attitude towards E. Taken together, \nthe facts support the conclusion that the employer dismissed E because of \ndiscrimination. Hence, the dismissal was wrongful.\n1 The Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment provides \nfurther guidance on how to retrench workers in a responsible manner.\n\n REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT GAZETTE 4\n11. Dismissing an employee to deprive the employee of benefits/entitlements \nthe employee would otherwise have earned is wrongful.\nIllustration 6\nF informed her employer of her pregnancy. She had worked for her employer \nfor 3 years. The employer dismissed her with notice soon after, without paying \nher maternity benefits.\nThe facts suggest the dismissal was with a view to deprive her of her maternity \nbenefits because:\n(a) The employer was unable to provide a legitimate reason for the dismissal;\n(b) The employee was dismissed shortly after she informed her employer of \nher pregnancy; and\n(c) The employer did not pay the employee her maternity benefits.\n12. Dismissing an employee to punish the employee for exercising his or \nher employment right, e.g. filing a mediation request with TADM, or declining a \nrequest to work overtime, is wrongful.\nIllustration 7\nG was a workman earning less than $4,500. He declined his employer’s request \nto work overtime as he needed to take care of his infant child. The employer \ndismissed him with notice. The employer told G that he could not afford to \nhave someone who prioritised his care-giving duties over working overtime.\nThe dismissal was wrongful as there was substantiated evidence from G that \nthe employer wanted to punish the employee for exercising his statutory right \nto decline to work overtime due to his care-giving duties.\nIllustration 8\nH filed a mediation request with TADM as his employer had not paid him his \nsalary for 3 months. The employer dismissed him with notice after finding out \nthat he had filed a request for mediation with TADM.\nThe dismissal was to punish H for exercising his right to file a mediation request \nwith TADM, and was wrongful as the facts indicate that it was to punish H for \nseeking remedy at TADM.\n\nFRIDAY, JUL Y  26, 2024 5\n13. If an employer gives a reason for dismissal with notice, but the reason \ngiven is proven to be false, the dismissal would also be wrongful.\nIllustration 9\nJ was told by his employer that his company was restructuring, and his job \nwould no longer exist. He was then dismissed with notice. J later found out \nthat what his employer said was not true. In fact, there remained a vacancy for \nthe exact job he used to do, and his former employer had recruited someone \nelse to fill his post.\nOn the face of it, this is a case of dismissal with notice. The employer did not \nneed to provide a reason. But he provided a reason, which was shown to be \nuntrue. Hence, the dismissal was wrongful.\n(V) Conclusion\n14. These guidelines set out what constitutes wrongful dismissal and what \ndoes not. With the transfer of the adjudication for wrongful dismissal to the \nEmployment Claims Tribunals, these guidelines will provide a reference for \nmediators and adjudicators at the TADM and ECT respectively. They also serve \nas a reference for HR practitioners, employers and employees, to better prepare \nall parties for the change in adjudicators, and also to prevent and minimise \ndisputes over dismissal matters."

You must provide for rest days, medical care and more.\nRest days\nYour MDW is entitled to one rest day per week. You and your MDW must mutually agree on which day of the week she should take the rest day.\nIf your MDW agrees to work on her rest day, you must compensate her with at least 1 day's salary (Note: This is an additional payment and is not counted into the MDW's basic salary.)\nHowever, you must ensure that your MDW has at least one rest day per month that cannot be compensated away.\nEmployers who fail to provide the mandatory rest day may be subjected to enforcement action.\nUpdate your MDW's number of rest days in FDW eService, after discussing with her how her rest day can be taken.\nRest days can be taken flexibly to suit the needs of both employers and MDWs:\n- The rest day can be taken as one full day or over two half days.\n- The MDW may choose to spend her rest day at home.\n- If the MDW is unable to take her rest day in a particular month, it can be deferred by up to one month. This means that the MDW should take her rest day by the end of the subsequent month.\nTo find out more on the rest day requirement, read the press release on mandatory rest days for migrant domestic workers, our guide for employers.\nEmployers who require further information or advice on the rest day arrangement may contact us through our online feedback form.\nInitial difficulties\nA new MDW from a rural area may encounter some of these difficulties:\n- Understanding and communicating in your language.\n- Using modern household appliances.\n- Adjusting to living in high-rise buildings.\n- Having different practices in taking care of children.\nShe will need time to familiarise herself with your way of life. You can help by taking time to orientate and train her, especially in the early stages of her employment.\nAccommodation\nYou must ensure that your MDW’s accommodation meets the following requirements:\n- Adequate shelter: the accommodation must adequately protect your MDW from environmental elements such as sun, rain or strong winds.\n- Basic amenities: you must minimally provide your MDW with a mattress, pillow, blanket, bathroom amenities and toiletries. Examples of toiletries include soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.\n- Sufficient ventilation: your MDW’s accommodation must be sufficiently ventilated. Mechanical ventilation (e.g. electrical fan) must be provided if natural ventilation is inadequate.\n- Safety: your MDW must not sleep near any dangerous equipment or structure that could potentially cause harm or hurt to her.\n- Modesty: your MDW must not sleep in the same room as a male adult or teenager. If you install video recording devices at home, you must inform your MDW of the devices and where they are placed. You must not install them in areas that will compromise her privacy or modesty, e.g. where she sleeps, change clothes, or the bathroom area.\n- Space and privacy: you should provide your MDW with a separate room. If that is not possible, you must ensure that her accommodation has adequate space and privacy.\nAdequate food\nYou must provide your MDW with 3 meals a day.\nAn example of a day’s food intake for a female engaged in moderate activity is as follows:\n- Breakfast: 4 slices of bread with spread.\n- Lunch: 1 bowl of rice + three-quarter cup of cooked vegetables + palm-sized amount of meat (fish/poultry/beef/lamb) + fruit\n- Dinner: 1 bowl of rice + three-quarter cup of cooked vegetables + palm-sized amount of meat (fish/poultry/beef/lamb) + fruit\nBe sensitive to your MDW’s needs when it comes to food. Do not force your MDW to eat food that she is not supposed to or is not comfortable with. For example, your MDW may not be able to eat certain food due to her religious beliefs, or she may not be accustomed to your family’s dietary requirements (e.g. vegetarian food or porridge).\nMedical care and vaccination\nAs an employer, you are responsible for your MDW’s medical needs. This includes:\nMDWs need to meet certain vaccination requirements. You should also assist your MDW with keeping her vaccination status up-to-date and providing sufficient rest after vaccinations.\nOpen communication\nYou MDW may experience homesickness and loneliness. You can help her cope with those feelings by teaching her how she could contact her family and how she could send letters home.\nFamily integration\nYou should try your best to integrate your MDW into your family. You can do that by being patient and tolerant and making an effort to understand her background.\nSafe work conditions\nYou must ensure that the MDW works safely. She will have to follow the approved work practices stipulated in MOM’s training materials and courses (e.g. the Employers’ Orientation Programme)."

Medical practitioners from national specialty centres and ambulatory surgical centres may also be able to admit patients into a hospital.\nHospitals refer to all public, private, or community hospitals.\nIf you are unsure if the medical practitioner who issued the hospitalisation leave can admit patients into a hospital, you may seek clarification directly with the relevant medical practitioner.\nCosmetic procedures\nEmployers are not required to grant paid sick leave or pay medical consultation fees for cosmetic procedures. The medical practitioner performing the examination will decide whether a procedure is for cosmetic reasons.\nYour company policy may cover this as an employee medical benefit.\nEntitlement\nThe number of days of paid sick leave you are entitled to depends on your period of service, up to 14 days for paid outpatient sick leave and 60 days for paid hospitalisation leave. The 60 days of paid hospitalisation leave includes the 14 days paid outpatient sick leave entitlement.\nIf you have worked for 6 months or more, you will get the full entitlement.\nPro-rated paid sick leave for new hires (under 6 months)\nIf you are a new employee, paid sick leave is pro-rated according to your length of service.\nYour month of service begins from the day you start work with your employer.\nYou must have worked for at least 3 months to be entitled to paid outpatient sick leave or paid hospitalisation leave.\nBetween 3 and 6 months of service, your entitlement is pro-rated.\nThe table below shows an example of an employee who starts work on 13 February 2023. Between 13 February to 12 May 2023, any sick leave taken will be unpaid.\n|\nNumber of months of service completed\n|\nEntitled to paid sick leave on |\nPaid outpatient sick leave (days)\n|\nPaid hospitalisation leave (days)\n|\n|\n3\n|\n13 May |\n5\n|\n15\n|\n|\n4\n|\n13 June |\n8\n|\n30\n|\n|\n5\n|\n13 July |\n11\n|\n45\n|\n|\n6 and thereafter\n|\n13 August |\n14\n|\n60 |\nLimits on paid sick leave days\nThe amount of paid outpatient sick leave and paid hospitalisation leave you can take is capped at your sick leave entitlement.\nIf you have already taken 14 days of paid outpatient sick leave in a year, the number of days of paid hospitalisation leave that you can take is 46 days (60 - 14 = 46).\nNotifying your employer for sick leave\nAs a responsible employee, you should inform your employer as soon as possible if you are unable to come to work. This allows your employer to plan for alternative work arrangements in your absence.\nIf you are unable to report for work, the Employment Act requires you to inform your employer within 48 hours. You should submit your medical certificate (MC) when you return to work."
